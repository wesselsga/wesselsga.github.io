# Build ffmpeg with 10-bit x265 support for encoding on Windows #

<div class="date">{{ page.date | date: "%-d %B %Y"}}</div>

So I was trying to create some 10-bit test HEVC content with ffmpeg and ran into the following error:

```Batchfile
...

Incompatible pixel format 'yuv420p10le' for codec 'libx265', auto-selecting format 'yuv420p'

...
```

I discovered that by default - most ffmpeg builds include only 8-bit support for HEVC encoding with libx265.

Certainly, you can get builds that already enable 10 or even 12-bit support - but I'm usually a glutton for punishment so I thought I would see how hard it was to just build it manually.

Here are the exact steps I did to build both ffmpeg and libx265 with Visual Studio 2017 on Windows.  Some of the steps will also detail some of the errors I ran into along the way - in case someone else runs into trouble, hopefully then it will show how to overcome any future hurdles.

> Note: This guide will only build the 64-bit versions, but you should be able to adjust for 32-bit.

### Build Tools ###
* git - to get the ffmpeg source code
* [TortoiseHg](https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/) - to get the x265 source code
* Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (you can probably get most versions 2015 and newer to work)
* CMAKE 3.xx
* YASM
  * Download [YASM](http://yasm.tortall.net/) 64-bit and copy to **C:\tools\yasm**
  * Rename **yasm-1.3.0-win64.exe** (or whatever version) to **yasm.exe**
  * Add **c:\tools\yasm** to your PATH environment variable
* Msys2
  * Download [Msys2](http://www.msys2.org/) installer for 64-bit and install to **C:\tools\msys64**
  * Navigate to **c:\Tools\msys64** and run **msys2_shell.cmd** when the msys2 shell opens, use pacman to install the following:
  
    ```Batchfile
    pacman -S gcc
    pacman -S diffutil
    pacman -S make
    pacman -S pkg-config
    pacman -S autoconf
    ```
    
  * Close the msys2 shell for now - we'll relaunch later from a Visual Studio command prompt 

### Build libx265 for 10-bit support ###

1. Download the x265 source code
   
   Create the directory **c:\third_party** and cd from a command prompt to it.  Run the command:
   
   ```Batchfile
   hg clone https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265
   ```

2. Navigate to **third_party\x265\build**. Find the directory that matches the VC compiler you want to use. It is likely there will not be one matching the newest version of Visual Studio, so use the latest one available (In my case it was **vc12-x86_64**)
   
   Using a text editor, open **make-solutions.bat**.  Change the generator command to match the version of VS you want to use.  I'm using 2017, so my command is:
   
   ```Batchfile
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" ..\..\source && cmake-gui ..\..\source
   ```
   
3. Run the **make-solutions.bat** - during the processing, the CMake GUI will open with properties highlighted red.
   * Check the `HIGH_BIT_DEPTH` for 10-bit
   * Set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to a directory the x265 lib, headers, and importantly the pkg-config .pc file will be installed to
   * Verify the `YASM_EXECUTABLE` property is pointing the location where you installed YASM
   
     ![alt text][cmake_1]
     <br/>
     <br/>
   
4. Press Configure
   * Another property called `MAIN12` will probably get highlighted in red.  This is for 12-bit support (if you want that check it).
   * Press Configure again
   * Press Generate
  
5. Open the **x265.sln** in Visual Studio - change the build type to Release and the Arch to x64

6. Change the C++ runtime to use static CRT (/MT) rather than the default (/MD) to match ffmpeg  

   > I did this for the **cli**, **common**, and **encoder** projects.

7. Build the **ALL_BUILD** project.

8. Build the **INSTALL** project - this is important for building ffmpeg next

9. Navigate to the location used in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` property above.  Verify you have bin, include and lib folders.

### Build ffmpeg with custom x265 build from above ###

1. Download the ffmpeg source code
   
   Create the directory **c:\third_party\ffmpeg** and cd from a command prompt to it.  Run the command:
   
   ```Batchfile
   git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg
   ```
   
   > This will result in the ffmpeg source tree located at **c:\third_party\ffmpeg\ffmpeg** which will be handy for an out-of-tree build
   
2. Create the directory **c:\third_party\ffmpeg\build**

3. Open a VS command prompt - I used the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017**

4. Change the directory - `cd` to **c:\tools\msys64**

5. Run the **msys2_shell.cmd** for msys2

6. Verify our x265 build with pkg-config

   ```Batchfile
   pkg-config --exists --print-errors x265
   ```
   
   This should fail with an error similar to the following, since we haven't told pkg-config where our x265 is.
   
   ```Batchfile
   Package x265 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
   Perhaps you should add the directory containing `x265.pc'
   to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
   No package 'x265' found
   ```
   
   Add the x265.pc install location to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` variable
   
   ```Batchfile
   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/c/x265/lib/pkgconfig
   ```
   
   Run the verify command again - you should get no error messages
   
   ```Batchfile
   pkg-config --exists --print-errors x265
   ```
   
7. Configure ffmpeg for a build.
  
   ```Batchfile
   cd /c/third_party/ffmpeg/ffbuild/
   ```
   
   There are many different ways to build ffmpeg - I'm doing the bare minimum here to get a ffmpeg build that can encode 10-bit x265:
   
   ```Batchfile
   ../ffmpeg/configure --toolchain=msvc prefix="win-build" \
   --pkg-config-flags="--static" \
   --disable-shared \
   --enable-libx265 \
   --enable-gpl
   ```
   
   If you're following this far, the above command should fail :(
   
   ```Batchfile
   ERROR: x265 not found using pkg-config
   ```
   
   We already verified that pkg_config could locate our x265 above, but the ffmpeg configure script is complaining  ...
   
   Open the **c:\third_party\ffmpeg\ffbuild\ffbuild\ffbuild\config.log** and scroll to the bottom.  You should see an error something like:
   
   ```Batchfile
   LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'x265.lib'
   ERROR: x265 not found using pkg-config
   ```
   
   Navigate to **C:\x265\lib**.  The x265 build from above created a static lib named **x265-static.lib** ... rename it to **x265.lib**
   
   Run the ffmpeg configure command again - this time it should be successful.
  
8. Build and install ffmpeg
  
   ```Batchfile
   make
   make install
   ```
  
9. Your fresh ffmpeg build should be at **c:\third_party\ffmpeg\ffbuild\win-build**

### Transcode some content to 10-bit HEVC ###
  
  1.  Create a test clip with something like:
  
      ```Batchfile
      ffmpeg -i "input.mkv" -c:v libx265 -preset slow -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -c:a copy -y output_10bit.mkv
      ```
  
  2.  Verify the video stream is 10-bit
  
      ```Batchfile
      ffmpeg -i "output_10bit.mkv"
      
      ... 
      
      Stream #0:0(eng): Video: hevc (Main 10), yuv420p10le(tv, progressive), 1280x720 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 59.94 fps, 59.94 tbr, 1k tbn, 59.94 tbc      
      
      ```
